EVE Academy are weekly professional wrestling training classes in East London for anyone who is a self-identifying woman, or is non-binary, femme presenting and comfortable in a woman-focused environment.

The classes will be lead by two-time EVE Champion, world-traveled professional wrestler and fitness instructor “The Fightin’ Irish” Rhia O’Reilly and London School of Lucha Libre head coach: professional wrestler-turned-film fight choreographer and stunt person Greg Burridge.

In addition to this we also have guest trainers booked in every month including Japanese wrestling legend Emi Sakura, American television wrestling personality Daffney, and numerous others from around the wrestling world ensuring the very best training and coaching at the EVE Academy.

As our aim is not just to help our trainees become the best professional wrestlers they can be but also to help build strong, loud and confident women, we have also scheduled optional defence classes taught by the former defensive skills instructor for Essex police.
