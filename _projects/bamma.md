<p><abbr class="initialism" title="British Association of Mixed Martial Arts">BAMMA</abbr> is the premier mixed martial arts organisation in Europe, featuring some of the best fighting talent outside of the <abbr class="initialism" title="Ultimate Fighting Championship">UFC</abbr>.
  BAMMA holds multiple events per year in arenas across the <abbr class="initialism" title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and broadcast live on Spike TV.</p>
<p>We began working with BAMMA in 2013.
  The company wanted a website that was fit for purpose and appealing to fans and sponsors alike.</p>
<p>Your Fight Site built the website using the CakePHP framework.
  Data was modelled to automatically create connections between relevant items, such as articles and media on events pages and fighter profiles.</p>
<p>Weâ€™ve worked together with BAMMA on honing the website since then, constantly adding improvements that make the website more immersive to fans, and easier to use for staff.
  A re-design of the website took place in mid-2015.</p>
