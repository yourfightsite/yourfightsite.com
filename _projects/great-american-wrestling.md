<p>Great American Wrestling, based in Knoxville, Tennessee, came to us in early 2015 looking for a web presence.
  They wanted a website to both showcase they TV show and also advertise dates for upcoming live events.</p>
<p>We built the website on our content management system, Your Fight Site CMS.
  We also integrated the site with YouTube, so that each time they uploaded a new episode to their channel it updates on the website automatically as well.</p>
