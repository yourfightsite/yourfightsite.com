<p>British Championship Wrestling is one of Your Fight Site’s oldest clients.
  We’ve worked with the Scotland-based promotion since 2005, when they were referred to us by our very first client.</p>
<p>In the near-10 years we’ve worked with <abbr class="initialism" title="British Championship Wrestling">BCW</abbr>, the website has undergone numerous facelifts, including one in 2008 when the company introduced a new logo; but has constantly remained a source of up-to-date information for the company’s fans.</p>
