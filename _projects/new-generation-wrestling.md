<p>Your Fight Site spoke with Richard Dunn of Hull-based New Generation Wrestling in 2010 and a year later Richard approached us looking to revamp of NGWâ€™s web presence.</p>
<p>Richard was looking for a more professional-looking website that clearly advertised upcoming events, but was also easy to use and easy for Richard and fellow NGW staff to update.</p>
<p>We developed a easily-navigatable website and also modified our Your Fight Site CMS to Richard's bespoke requirements for the site. The CMS now allows Richard to upload assets such as high-resolution show posters to an on-line area via an Image Library CMS module, to be used for displaying on forums and other on-line advertisements.</p>
