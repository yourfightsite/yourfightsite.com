<p>Premier British Wrestling is currently one of the UK's fastest-growing professional wrestling promotions. Since their d√©but in March 2006, Your Fight Site has worked alongside them, designing and developing their official website and branding, including logo.</p>
<p>Towards the end of 2011, Premier British Wrestling asked Your Fight Site to give the PBW website a complete overhaul to go with their re-branding from a primarily red to primarily blue colour palette.</p>
<p>As well as overhauling the design of the site, we made several changes to make the site both more interactive and engaging, with latest news more prominently displayed on the home page and greater emphasis on upcoming events.</p>
