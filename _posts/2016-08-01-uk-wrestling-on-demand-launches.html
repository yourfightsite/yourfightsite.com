<p>We at Your Fight Site are pleased to announce the launch of <a href="http://www.ukwrestlingondemand.com/" rel="external">UK Wrestling On Demand</a>,
  a brand new subscription video on demand service featuring content from multiple wrestling promotions.</p>
<p>The new channel builds on the success of Pro Wrestling Chaos’s subscription on demand channel,
  and sees the addition of Coventry’s Triple X Wrestling.</p>
<p>All of Pro Wrestling Chaos’s back catalogue is available, as are select titles from Triple X Wrestling.</p>
<p>Both promotions will be adding fresh, new content over the coming months and not just in-ring action.</p>
<p>Available now is <a href="https://vod.yourfightsite.com/titles/behind-the-chaos" rel="external">Behind The Chaos</a>, a sit-down interview with the three owners of Pro Wrestling Chaos.</p>
<p>“An Evening with Chris Hero” will also be available soon, which sees stories from the life of the WWE NXT and Ring of Honor superstar.</p>
<p>The service will grow in the future, with more wrestling promotions.
  Dedicated apps are also scheduled for Roku, iOS, and Apple TV so you can watch on your TV or mobile/tablet.</p>
<p>All of this great content&mdash;and all future content&mdash;is available for just &pound;3.99 a month.
  To view available titles and subscribe, simply visit <a href="http://www.ukwrestlingondemand.com/" rel="external">ukwrestlingondemand.com</a>.</p>
