What’s new on the Your Fight Site CMS platform this week.

## New-look admin panel

Earlier this year we unveiled [a new look for Your Fight Site][1]. We’ve applied
this new look to the administration panel for all websites. This is merely a
cosmetic change, as everything in the admin panel is still in the same location
and still works the same.

## Article comments
Users can now comment on news articles. Users will need to log in or sign up
before leaving a comment, increasing engagement and user bases of websites.

Submitted comments are placed in a review queue, which can then be approved or
deleted from your website administration panel.

## Past events listing
Websites now feature a listing of past events, allowing fans to find results of
events they may have missed. Events created via your administration panel will
automatically show up in this list once the event has passed.

## Import photo albums from Facebook

You can now import photo albums from a Facebook Page into your website. You can
do this via the new “Photo Albums” page that’s under the “Content” section in
the administration menu.

The first time you attempt to import an album, you’ll be asked to authorise your
Facebook account. You’ll then be asked which Page you want to connect to your
website. Once you’ve successfully connected a Page, you can then choose which
album from your Page you wish to import.

<div class="clearfix"></div>
As albums on Facebook may contain lots of photos, imports are queued and
performed as a background task, so you can get on with managing your website
whilst the platform retrieves photos from your albums. We’ll send you an email
when an album has finished importing, letting you check over its contents before
publishing it to your website.

This feature is currently a “beta” feature, which means we’re still working on
it, so we would welcome any feedback you may have on the feature in its current
state.
