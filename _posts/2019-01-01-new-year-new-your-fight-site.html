<p>Hello, and a happy new year to all visitors!</p>
<p>If this isn’t the first time you’ve visited the website, you’ll notice we’re looking a little different.
  2019 will be our <strong>10<sup>th</sup></strong> year in business, and we’re celebrating it with a refresh of our brand.</p>
<p>With this new logo and branding comes a new focus.
  Our aim is&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;and always has been&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;to make independent wrestling promotions look the best they can online.
  The team at Your Fight Site has worked with independent wrestling promotions before Your Fight Site was born, amassing <strong>over 15 years</strong> helping independent wrestling promotions.
  Since then, we’ve widened our expertise to help promoters in other combat sports such as <abbr title="Mixed Martial Arts">MMA</abbr> and boxing.
</p>
<p>Our offering is now laser-focused. For 2019, we will be focusing on the following areas:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="mb-2">
    <strong>Web design.</strong>
    We’ve distilled our vast knowledge of designing and developing wrestling, <abbr title="Mixed Martial Arts">MMA</abbr>, and boxing websites
    into an easy-to-use platform. We launched the second iteration in 2018 and welcomed new promotion
    <a href="https://www.wrestlegatepro.com" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Wrestle Gate</a> as the first customer.
  </li>
  <li class="mb-2">
    <strong>Video on demand (VOD).</strong>
    In 2014, we launched what was perhaps the first professional wrestling-focused <abbr class="initialism" title="Video On Demand">VOD</abbr> platform.
    We have slowly grown it since then with dedicated content providers, and plan to continue to do so.

  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Event ticketing.</strong>
    Our aforementioned website platform issues digital event tickets.
    We want to get away from the practice of, &ldquo;Your PayPal&trade; receipt is your ticket.&rdquo;
    We’re working on apps to let event organisers check attendees in using just your mobile phone,
    enabling you to manage attendees the same way as promoters of large concerts and arena shows do&hellip; for free.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve thoroughly enjoyed working with some amazing clients over the past 10 years and we look forward to working with existing clients&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;and new ones&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;over the next 10 years.
  Why don’t you join us on that journey as well?</p>
