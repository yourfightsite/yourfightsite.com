title: "Your Fight Site SSO coming soon"
---
<p>In late 2014 we launched Your Fight Site <abbr class="initialism" title="Video On Demand">VOD</abbr>, a pro wrestling video on demand website.
  We’re pleased with the number of registrations on the website, and Your Fight Site VOD is the first product in a line we’re launching, with more to come.</p>
<p>Most sites require registration to use, and the ones we have in the pipeline are no different.
  However, we at Your Fight Site <em>hate</em> having to remember different log ins for different sites.
  That’s why we’ll soon be introducing <strong>Your Fight Site <abbr class="initialism" title="Single Sign-On">SSO</abbr></strong>.</p>
<p>Your Fight Site <abbr class="initialism" title="Single Sign-On">SSO</abbr> will allow you to use the same log in credentials across all of our sites.
  You’ll also be able to use your social network accounts (such as Facebook and Twitter) to log into Your Fight Site applications.</p>
<p>We’ll be implementing Your Fight Site <abbr class="initialism" title="Single Sign-On">SSO</abbr> on Your Fight Site <abbr class="initialism" title="Video On Demand">VOD</abbr> first.
  You won’t need to do any thing, and your email address and password you use to log in with will remain the same.
  It does mean you will be able to use any new Your Fight Site services straight away with the same email address and password, though!</p>
<p>If you have any questions about Your Fight Site <abbr class="initialism" title="Single Sign-On">SSO</abbr>, then email us at <a href="mailto:&#x69;n&#x66;o&#64;y&#x6f;&#117;&#114;&#x66;&#x69;&#x67;&#x68;&#116;s&#x69;&#116;e.&#99;&#x6f;&#x6d;?subject=Your+Fight+Site+SSO">&#x69;n&#x66;o&#64;y&#x6f;&#117;&#114;&#x66;&#x69;&#x67;&#x68;&#116;s&#x69;&#116;e.&#99;&#x6f;&#x6d;</a>.</p>
