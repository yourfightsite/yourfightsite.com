We’re pleased to announce the launch of the next version of [Your Fight Site CMS][1],
with [Wrestle Gate Pro][2] as the very first website to launch on this new verison.

In the first version, Your Fight Site CMS served just professional wrestling
websites. Its capabilities have now been extended to also support other combat
sport websites including <abbr class="initialism" title="Mixed Martials Arts">MMA</abbr>
and boxing.

Your Fight Site CMS has been re-built from the ground up and thoroughly tested,
offering the following features…

* Events
* Tickets
* Roster (wrestlers&thinsp;/&thinsp;fighters)
* News articles
* Shop

…and more.

The platform will be continually developed. Here are a few things that are on
our roadmap:

* Deep social media integration (Facebook&thinsp;/&thinsp;Twitter)
* Support for different payment methods (Apple Pay, Google Pay etc)
* Training session and seminar management
* Managing press credentials for events

We will also be integrating Your Fight Site CMS with our video on demand platform,
[Your Fight Site VOD][3], so customers who also have a video on demand channel
will benefit from a seamless integration between their website and channel.

In the coming months, we will be migrating customers from the previous version
of Your Fight Site CMS to the new version. We’re also taking on new customers.
If you would like to see how Your Fight Site CMS could work for your wrestling,
<abbr class="initialism" title="Mixed Martials Arts">MMA</abbr>, or boxing website
then <a data-toggle="modal" data-services="web-design" href="#quote">get in touch</a>.
