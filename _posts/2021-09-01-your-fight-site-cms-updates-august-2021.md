## Refreshed admin panel
We’ve given our admin panel for websites a little lick of paint. The layout for the most part is the same, but now looks better and is easier to use on smaller devices such as mobiles and tablets.

## Consilidated billing and subscription area
There’s now a single area to manage your website subscription and billing settings. From the same screen you can create a subscription if your website needs one, as well as update the payment method used to pay your subscription. We now also show a list of invoices for past payments in case you need to download a receipt for your accounts.

## New wrestling website launch: Lion Wrestling Promotions
We’re pleased to announce the launch of the new [Lion Wrestling Promotions][1] website on [Your Fight Site CMS][2]. Lion Wrestling Promotions are based on the east coast of England and hold family-friendly shows in the local area. So do get along to a show if you’re nearby.

## Affiliates
This month we also soft-launched our new affiliates feature. Website owners to create affiliates and affiliate codes. When URLs containing an affiliate code are visited, any tickets or shop orders placed will then be associated with that affiliate code. This means website owners can now give links to third parties and track which affiliates are generating sales for your website, and how much.

We’ll be building on this feature over the coming months. If you’re interested in using it on your website then do [contact us][3]
